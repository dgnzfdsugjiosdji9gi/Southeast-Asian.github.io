        <h1>Education in the Philippines</h1>
        <p>The Philippine education system follows the K-12 program, which includes primary, secondary, and higher education. It aims to provide students with a holistic learning experience, equipping them with the necessary knowledge and skills for their future careers. The education sector continues to evolve, incorporating modern technology and global best practices.</p>

    <div class="connaiter text-center">
        <h2>Primary Education</h2>
        <p>Primary education in the Philippines is mandatory for children aged six to twelve. 
            It lasts for six years, divided into two cycles: the first cycle (Grades 1 to 3) 
            focuses on foundational skills in reading, writing, and arithmetic, while the second 
            cycle (Grades 4 to 6) builds on these skills and introduces more specialized subjects 
            such as science, social studies, and languages. The Department of Education (DepEd) 
            oversees the curriculum and ensures that schools across the country provide quality 
            education. The primary language of instruction is Filipino, with English also being used 
            for specific subjects. Education at this level is free in public schools, and the 
            government provides support to ensure children have access to learning materials. 
            Despite the availability of free education, challenges such as overcrowded classrooms 
            and a lack of resources persist, particularly in rural areas. However, the government 
            has made efforts to improve facilities and teacher training, aiming to enhance the overall educational experience.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Secondary Education</h2>
        <p>Secondary education in the Philippines typically lasts for six years, 
            divided into two levels: Junior High School (Grades 7 to 10) and Senior 
            High School (Grades 11 to 12). Junior High School focuses on expanding 
            students' knowledge in various subjects such as mathematics, science, 
            English, Filipino, social studies, and physical education. At this level, 
            students are also introduced to technical-vocational education, and they 
            start to explore potential career pathways.Senior High School was introduced 
            in 2016 as part of the K-12 education reform, aiming to better prepare students 
            for higher education, employment, or entrepreneurship. It consists of two years 
            (Grades 11 and 12), during which students choose from different tracks: Academic, 
            Technical-Vocational-Livelihood, Arts and Design, or Sports. The academic track 
            is further divided into strands such as Science, Technology, Engineering, and 
            Mathematics (STEM), Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS), and Accountancy, 
            Business, and Management (ABM).The Department of Education (DepEd) regulates secondary
             education in the Philippines, and while public secondary schools offer free 
             education, many students attend private schools for additional resources or 
             specialized programs. Despite these efforts, challenges like overcrowded classrooms, 
             limited facilities, and disparities between urban and rural education remain issues in the system.</p>
